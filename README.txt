Qdb: a really simple remote client/server debugger for Python

What?

Python Bdb (stdlib) based debugger
Remote: attachable from external processes (even on other machines)
Client/Server: a backend designed to run with several frontends (wx, web2py, etc.)
Simple & Small: just a enhanced Pdb
Why?

pdb is text only (and local process), this causes big troubles with wx and web servers
rpdb2 (winpdb) is too complex to use/extend in my case (rpdb2 is 14500 LOC against ~700 LOC of this script)
I need this for a totally integrated IDE I'm writing (see rad2py)
IPC/RPC Flexibility: supports Threading Queues, Multiprocessing Pipes and Sockets
Cross-Version (py2.6+ & py3k), Cross-Platform (win/linux/mac interoperability) (work in progress)
How?

bdb: Python Debugger framework
multiprocessing: listeners/clients: queue/pipe communication (serialization w/ pickle) requires python 2.6+
JSON-RPC: JSON-like Remote Procedure Call protocol over stream connections (see also simplejsonrpc.py in this project)
Cmd: cmd â€” Support for line-oriented command interpreters
wxpython: toolkit for visual interface

Commands

The Command Line Interface accepts is very similar to pdb:

c: Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.
s: Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion
n: Execute the current line, do not stop at function calls
r: Continue execution until the current function returns
p: Inspect the value of the expression
w: Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.
l [from:to]: List source code for the current file
j lineno: Set the next line that will be executed.
b filename:lineno: Set a breakpoint at filename:breakpoint
h: help
q: Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.

Usage

Standalone

First, ensure you have qdb.py installed in your python path (or in the current directory).

The call the python interpreter with the option -m qdb and your script name. This will load your program under qdb debugging.

Sample Session in the backend:

reingart@desktop:~/rad2py/ide2py$ python -m qdb hola.py qdb debugger backend: waiting for connection at ('localhost', 6000) qdb debugger backend: connected to ('127.0.0.1', 52322)

Then, in other terminal, run the python interpreter with the option -m qdb only. This will launch the qdb attached to the debugging session.

Sample session in the frontend (Command Line Interface): ``` reingart@desktop:~/rad2py/ide2py$ python -m qdb qdb debugger fronted: waiting for connection to ('localhost', 6000) running hola.py

hola.py(3) -> name = raw_input("please write your name:") (Cmd) n please write your name: mariano hola.py(4) -> print "hello", name (Cmd) !name = 'Mariano' None hola.py(4) -> print "hello", name (Cmd) n hello Mariano hola.py(6) -> def factorial(n): (Cmd) l hola.py: 1 # sample file to test shell & debugger hola.py: 2 hola.py: 3 name = raw_input("please write your name:") hola.py: 4 print "hello", name hola.py: 5 hola.py: 6-> def factorial(n): hola.py: 7 """This is the "factorial" function hola.py: 8 >>> factorial(5) hola.py: 9 120 hola.py: 10 hola.py: 11 """ ```

Note: (Cmd) is the prompt, just type your command (i.e. n) and hit enter.
